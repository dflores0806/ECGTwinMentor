![ECGTwinMentor Architecture](images/ECGTwinMentorAR.png)

ECGTwinMentor simulates a digital twin of an ECG diagnostic system. Users can input or generate ECG parameters, select a diagnosis they believe is correct, and compare it with a prediction generated by a trained machine learning model.

The system is designed to be deployed flexibly in both **cloud environments** (via web applications) and **edge devices** (such as Android smartphones or Raspberry Pi), enabling both connected and fully offline use cases.

### Main Components

- **Frontend (Cloud)**: A web interface (React) that allows users to input ECG parameters, request predictions, and generate ECG waveform visualizations. It communicates with the backend via RESTful POST requests.

- **Backend (FastAPI)**: The backend service receives user inputs, invokes the prediction model, and returns the results. It also provides endpoints for generating ECG images and serving model updates to edge devices.

- **AI Module (DL Model)**: A deep learning model trained to classify common cardiopathies. It is used both in the cloud (via FastAPI) and on edge devices (converted to TensorFlow Lite format).

- **Edge Devices (Raspberry Pi, Android)**: Local applications that embed the TFLite model for fast, offline inference. These apps support ECG parameter input, local prediction, and model updates via a defined endpoint.

This hybrid architecture ensures accessibility, responsiveness, and adaptability across a range of deployment scenarios, particularly in educational environments with limited infrastructure.

## üß™ ECG Parameters Considered

ECGTwinMentor processes a set of key ECG parameters as input to simulate and predict heart conditions. These parameters are commonly used in clinical analysis and ECG interpretation.

| Parameter           | Description                                                           | Example Values         |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `Heart_Rate`        | Number of heartbeats per minute (BPM).                                | 60‚Äì100 BPM             |
| `PR_Interval`       | Time between atrial and ventricular depolarization.                   | 120‚Äì200 ms             |
| `QRS_Duration`      | Duration of ventricular depolarization.                               | 80‚Äì120 ms              |
| `ST_Segment`        | Represents the interval between ventricular depolarization and repolarization. | -0.5 to 2.0 mV     |
| `QTc_Interval`      | Corrected QT interval, adjusted for heart rate.                       | 350‚Äì450 ms             |
| `Electrical_Axis`   | Direction of electrical depolarization through the ventricles.        | -30¬∞ to +90¬∞           |
| `Rhythm`            | Type of cardiac rhythm. Categorical value.                            | Sinus, Bradycardia, Tachycardia, Atrial Fibrillation |
| `T_Wave`            | Morphology of the T wave. Categorical value.                          | Normal, Inverted, Peaked, Flattened |

These parameters are used both for simulating realistic ECG signals and for feeding the AI model to predict potential cardiopathies.

## ü§ñ Deep Learning Model

The model is defined as a fully connected neural network with the following structure:
- Input layer: accepts 8 standardized ECG parameters
- Hidden layers:
  - Dense(128) with ReLU activation
  - Dense(64) with ReLU activation
  - Dense(32) with ReLU activation
- Output layer: Dense layer with softmax activation corresponding to the number of diagnostic classes

During training:
- The model is compiled with the `Adam` optimizer and `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` as loss function.
- Early stopping is applied to avoid overfitting based on validation loss.
- The training set is balanced using **SMOTE** to correct class imbalances.
- Training and validation loss and accuracy are plotted and saved.
- A confusion matrix, classification report, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R¬≤ score are computed.

### üì§ Export

After training, the model is exported to:
- `.h5` format using `model.save(...)`
- `.tflite` using TensorFlow Lite Converter
- `.onnx` using `tf2onnx.convert.from_function(...)` *(note: ONNX export may require local conversion if compatibility issues arise)*

### üîç Sample Prediction

A random test sample is selected and passed through the model to:
- Display the predicted and actual class
- Show class probabilities (softmax)
- Indicate prediction confidence

### üß™ How to Run the Python Script (`.py` version)

To execute the training and export process from the `.py` file instead of Colab:

```bash
python -m venv ecg_env
# Activate on Windows:
ecg_env\Scripts\activate
# Activate on macOS/Linux:
source ecg_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ecgtwinmentor_colab.py
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Options

ECGTwinMentor has been designed to support flexible deployment across multiple environments, enabling both online (cloud) and offline (edge) usage. This multiplatform capability allows the system to adapt to various educational and technical contexts.


### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Computing

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

To deploy and run ECGTwinMentor in a cloud environment, the following components and versions are recommended:

- **Node.js** ‚â• 16.x (for the React frontend)
- **Python** ‚â• 3.8 (for the FastAPI backend)
- **pip** and **virtualenv** (for backend dependency management)
- **TensorFlow** ‚â• 2.10 (to support model handling and inference)
- **Docker** *(optional)* for containerized deployment
- A server or cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP) to host frontend and backend components

#### üì¶ Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the `cloud` directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/dflores0806/ECGTwinMentor.git
cd ECGTwinMentor/cloud
```

##### üåê Frontend

The frontend is developed using **React**, providing an interactive web interface that allows users to:

- Input ECG parameters manually or generate examples
- Trigger predictions using the backend AI model
- Visualize ECG waveform simulations
- Compare user-selected diagnoses with model output

It communicates with the backend via **REST API** and is designed to be lightweight, responsive, and intuitive for educational use.

The frontend is located in the `cloud/frontend/` directory and can be run in development mode locally or deployed to a static hosting service such as AWS Amplify, Netlify, or Vercel.

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Default users login are:

```
admin:admin123  ‚Üí Can use ECGTwinMentor, export and delete statistics (role admin)
demo:demo       ‚Üí Can use ECGTwinMentor (role user)
```

This users can be edited in `backend/.env`.

This will start the frontend on http://localhost:3000

##### üß† Backend

The backend is implemented using **FastAPI**, a modern Python framework for building APIs. It serves as the core of the system‚Äôs logic and includes:

- An endpoint for ECG prediction using the trained deep learning model
- Utilities for parameter validation and response formatting
- TFLite model handling for fast and efficient inference
- Support for CORS to enable communication with the frontend

The backend is located in the `cloud/backend/` directory and is launched using `uvicorn`. It exposes REST endpoints that the frontend uses to request predictions and manage interactions.

```
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The backend API will be available at http://localhost:8000. By default, it serves on port `8000` and can be deployed to cloud providers such as AWS EC2, Azure App Service, or Google Cloud Run.

### üì± Edge Computing

ECGTwinMentor can also be deployed on edge devices to support offline, low-latency usage scenarios (Raspberry Pi and Android). This is especially useful in educational contexts where connectivity is limited or when rapid, local execution is needed.


#### üß™ Model Conversion

To enable efficient inference on edge devices, the original deep learning model trained with Keras is converted into TensorFlow Lite format (`.tflite`).

The conversion process involves:

1. **Training** a standard `.h5` model using Keras.
2. **Converting** the model to `.tflite` using TensorFlow‚Äôs built-in converter:
   ```python
   import tensorflow as tf
   model = tf.keras.models.load_model('ecg_model.h5')
   converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
   tflite_model = converter.convert()
   with open('ecg_model.tflite', 'wb') as f:
       f.write(tflite_model)
   ```
3. **Deploying** the `.tflite` model to:
   - `edge/android/app/src/main/assets/` (Android app)
   - `edge/raspberry/` (Raspberry Pi script)

The model preserves input shape and supports 8 features including numerical and categorical parameters. It is optimized for fast execution on mobile and embedded devices.

#### üçì Raspberry Pi

This edge deployment runs a local Python script on a Raspberry Pi device to perform ECG predictions using the TensorFlow Lite model.

##### ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Raspberry Pi OS with Python ‚â• 3.7
- `tflite_runtime` installed (lightweight TensorFlow interpreter)
- `numpy`, `requests`, `argparse` (standard Python packages)
- Internet connection only required for optional model updates

Install dependencies:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install tflite_runtime numpy requests
```

##### üìñ User Guide

1. Place the `ecg_model.tflite` file in the Raspberry Pi script directory.
2. Run predictions using command-line arguments with ECG values.
3. Update the model remotely with the `update` command.
